In MongoDB, aggregation operations process the data records/documents and return computed results. It collects values from various documents and groups them together and then performs different types of operations on that grouped data like sum, average, minimum, maximum, etc to return a computed result.

Accumulators: These are basically used in the group stage

sum: It sums numeric values for the documents in each group
count: It counts total numbers of documents
avg: It calculates the average of all given values from all documents
min: It gets the minimum value from all the documents
max: It gets the maximum value from all the documents
first: It gets the first document from the grouping
last: It gets the last document from the grouping
