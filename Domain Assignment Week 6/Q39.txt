Fetch all data from the collection
If we want to fetch all documents from the collection the following mongodb command can be used :

>db.userdetails.find();
or
>db.userdetails.find().pretty();

N.B. find() method displays the documents in a non structured format but to display the results in a formatted way, the pretty() method can be used.
